			XBase and DBD::XBase
		------------------------------------

This is README file for the XBase and DBD::XBase packages. Please
note that these are new modules, so the docs need more polishing and
will be coming briefly.

The man page XBase(3) is included.

Briefly, what is this about? This module should replace the Xbase-1.07
module, the main change (currently) are the added writing capabilities.
The package that actualy deals with the data files, is XBase. DBD::XBase
is intended DBD::* interface but it does not exist yet.

I would appreciate any nice little scripts that I could put into the
t directory. Also, nice tables with interesting features would help me
in writing the parsers.

And yes, this is alpha software. I will be glad to hear about you
testing it and I will try to fix any bugs and add new features but
please, test it on a backup copy of your data. The more tests we do
now, the sooner we can feel the module is safe and usable.
